For now this project is still pretty small, but here are some general guidelines on how to contribute to this repository

- This project ships with a code style config in .idea, your IDE should automatically apply it when you pull the repo.
When making pull requests, please try to keep to this style as much as possible.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), and scope as much as you can.
- One of the core ideas of this project is *not* using the IntellIJ parser/tokenizer. If you want to work with that
system, check out [intellij-zig](https://github.com/intellij-zig/intellij-zig).
